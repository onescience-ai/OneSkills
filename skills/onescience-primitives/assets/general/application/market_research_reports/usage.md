# typical_workflow

1. Match the task to `general.application.market_research_reports` by domain, package, workflow, or artifact type.
2. Retrieve the summary content first and inspect `knowledge_assets` when detailed guidance is needed.
3. Bind task-specific inputs, versions, and provenance before choosing an execution route.
4. Hand off computation to a reviewed executor, notebook, or future execution asset.
5. Return outputs with limitations, validation checks, and source assumptions.

# source_usage_signals

- imitate or imply affiliation with a consulting, analyst, or research brand;
- invent citations, quotes, market shares, or paid-market figures;
- present TAM/SAM/SOM or a forecast as one certain truth;
- treat a framework, chart, or fluent narrative as evidence;
- provide investment, legal, antitrust, tax, accounting, or regulatory advice.
- decision, audience, deadline, and materiality threshold;

# migrated_knowledge

Use `content_request: "参考资料"` to retrieve the indexed source references. Use `content_request: "完整参考资料"` only when detailed source text is needed.

This primitive does not expose execution assets yet. Source scripts remain candidates and must pass allowlist, hash, dependency, and side-effect review before promotion.

If `metadata.json.source_payloads` is present, treat those files as preserved migration material only. They can inform future executor design, but they must not be run or imported until promoted through an explicit execution-asset whitelist.
